**General Rule** : if not cited, you are claiming that it is your own work.\
**Five-consecutive-word Rule**\
So we need paraphrasing

- Different grammar/sentense structure

Style:
- MLA
- - Modern Language Association
- APA
- CMS
- AAAS
- **AIAA**
- ACS
- IEEE has many different styles


# Technical Project Deliverables
**Deliverables:**
- Project
- Solution
- Finding
- Publication
- Patent\
all end up with a report


**TC element**
- Audience
- - Potential/existing customers, fellow engineers, colleagues from other departments
- - Professors, classmates, staffs
- - General readers interested
- Information
- - Project's 'result' (not everything of the project)
- Purpose
- - Promote new product, share experience, establish status within, provide solution...


**General Design Logic**
- Describe problem at hand
- - General/broad topic
- - Narrow down gradually
- Analyze need
