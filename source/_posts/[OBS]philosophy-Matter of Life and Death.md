## ideology != philosophy
philosophy will never judge the correctness of reality while ideology will.
关于ideology,例如苏联的连环杀人狂，在资本世界才有连环杀人于是苏联对于自己国家的杀人狂不追查，认为不存在。

## ethics definition
The philosophy of relation.
Doesn't judge anything, just describe all the interaction.(unlike morality)

## deontology
There is no reason for that. The reason is simply because of being.
Dead-end for ethical argument.

## consequentialism
The ends justify the means(the efforts for getting the result).
